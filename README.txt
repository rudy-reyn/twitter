Project done in my advanced analytics business analytics class. 
Used the twitter API and the tweepy wrapper in python to scrape tweets from twitter during and after the shooting in Boulder that killed 10 people and injured 2. I've uploaded a csv file containing the results of the search. There's about 200,000 tweets gathered, with some duplicates after accounting for retweets and such.
